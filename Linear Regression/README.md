## Recap
In this lesson, you were introduced to linear models. Specifically, you saw:

* Gradient descent as a method to optimize your linear models.
* Multiple Linear Regression as a technique for when you are comparing more than two variables.
* Polynomial Regression for relationships between variables that aren't linear.
* Regularization as a technique to assure that your models will not only fit to the data available, but also extend to new situations.


## Outro
In this lesson, you were predicting quantitative values. Predicting quantitative values is often just considered a `Regression` problem. In the next lesson, you will be introduced to predicting a category, which is called a `Classification` problem.
