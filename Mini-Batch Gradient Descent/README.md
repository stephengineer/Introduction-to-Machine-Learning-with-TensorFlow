## Mini-Batch Gradient Descent Quiz

In this quiz, you'll be given the following sample dataset (as in data.csv), and your goal is to write a function that executes mini-batch gradient descent to find a best-fitting regression line. You might consider looking into numpy's `matmul` function for this!
